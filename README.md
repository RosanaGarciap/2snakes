# cycle üêç vs üêç

Cycle is a game where 2 players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail of their snakes tails behind them.

### Rules
- Each player's trail grows as they move.
- Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
- If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
-- A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
-- The cycles turn white.
-- Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.

## Purpose

This game is part of CSE-210 Programming with Classes course. The objective of this is help students to implement Polymorphism in this python code

## template
To build this course the 'snake' example was used as base for the developmen.

### Classes and Polimorphys

The polymorfism will be present in the Snakes and the keyboard controls since the main difference between them lies in the fact thatthey use different keys 
and the snakes are of different colors, therefore, they both share the attirbutes of snake class but they are handle for different keys.

Note: At the present time, the only condition implemented is the number 1 for one player (trail grows as its move.)
